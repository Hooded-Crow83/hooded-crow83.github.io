## What is Blind Soccer

Blind soccer is exhilarating to both play and watch. An adaptation of the world’s most popular sport for athletes with a visual impairment, blind soccer is fast-paced, physical and technical. Blind soccer players need to have speed, strength and stamina, as well as excellent spatial awareness despite their lack of vision, allowing them to be effective on the pitch and play together as a team. We’ll kick off our fall season with a blind soccer clinic for anyone who is interested in playing or learning more about the game.  Adults of all skill and experience levels are encouraged to attend!
