## Goalball?

Come out and play GOALBALL, the only team sport specifically designed for blind and visually impaired players!  We welcome folks of all ages, skill, and experience levels.  GBSA has been training and coaching goalball athletes since 2000, and counts multiple national and world champions and Paralympic medalists among our current members and alumni.  Goalball practice sessions are currently held every Saturday morning from 9 AM to Noon at Coan Park in Atlanta.
