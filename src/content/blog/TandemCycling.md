## What is Tandem Cycling

Tandem cycling is a great way to stay active and feel part of a team. Riding a tandem bike requires good communication and trust. Tandem bikes are built for two riders, one behind the other. The blind or visually impaired rider is called a stoker and rides behind the sighted rider who is called the pilot. The stoker’s focus is to provide the horsepower while the pilot’s focus is navigation and gears in addition to powering the bike forward with the stoker. There are some caveats to riding a tandem bike versus riding a single bike. For instance, on a tandem, turns should be taken wider to account for the length of the bike. Mounting and dismounting the bike tend to the be the most difficult parts of the ride.
