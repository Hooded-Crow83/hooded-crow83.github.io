## Kayaking

Spend a relaxing summer day paddling across a lake with our adaptive kayaking group. Whether you are an expert at kayaking or maybe you've never even stepped foot into a kayak, GBSA provides a welcoming environment to enthusiasts of all levels.  No experience is needed!  Our kayak and water safety instructors will provide all participants with direction on paddling the boats and the use of personal floatation devices.  Kayaking events are held on select Saturdays during the summer and rotates between several parks around North Georgia.  Some previous locations include Red Top Mountain State Park, Sweetwater Creek State Park, and Panola Mountain State Park.
