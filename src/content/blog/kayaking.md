## Kayaking

Wether you are an expert at kayaking or maybe you've never even stepped foot into a kayak, GBSA provides a welcoming environment to enthusiasts of all levels. We have experienced individuals who are ready to accompany you and keep you safe. All while having a blast!

## Questions

#### What if I can not paddle for very long?
Do not worry. That is the beauty of a tandem kayak. You can take a break while your partner continues to paddle. We would be happy to take you out for a ride and enjoy being on the water, even if you do not wish to paddle.

#### Is kayaking difficult to learn?
Kayaking is easy to pick up. It is a very gentle motion. We have mentors who will take you out in a tandem (double) kayak to teach you the basics. You will be surprised how fast you become an expert at paddling and steering your kayak.

#### Do I need to bring a life jacket?
Georgia Association of Blind Sports provides all equipment for our kayaking program including equipment, safety gear, and great coaches.

#### How do blind and visually impaired individuals participate in adaptive kayaking?
Individuals who have a visual impairment can kayak in a tandem kayak or a single kayak. When in a single kayak there is a mentor that serves as a guide, giving auditory cues.
